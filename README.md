# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures Practice in C++

Welcome to my Data Structures practice repository! This repo contains implementations of various data structures in C++, along with example programs to demonstrate how they work.

## ðŸ§  What You'll Find Here

- âœ… Arrays
- âœ… Vectors
- âœ… Stacks (Array based)
- âœ… Sorting & Searching Algorithms
<!--- âœ… Queues (Simple, Circular, and Priority)
- âœ… Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- âœ… Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)
- âœ… Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix, DFS, BFS)
- âœ… Recursion & Backtracking -->

### Command to run vector files
- g++ -std=c++11 vectors.cpp && ./a.out
